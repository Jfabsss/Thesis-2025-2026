# Git Basics

Clone the repository and get set up:

```
git clone git@github.com:Jfabsss/Thesis-2025-2026.git
git fetch
git checkout testing
git pull

```

### Workflow for Making Changes
1. Create a new branch from the testing branch
Example:
```
git checkout -b feat/registration-page testing

```

2. Fetch the latest branches

```

git fetch

```
3. Make your changes
Add your feature or fix your bug here.

4. Stage files (avoid git add .)
Be specific when staging:

bash
Copy code
git add file1.tsx file2.tsx .gitignore
5. Commit your changes
Use a clear commit message format:

For fixes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "fix: corrected button alignment"
For features:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "feat: added registration page"
6. Push your branch
bash
Copy code
git push origin feat/registration-page
7. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Target branch: testing.

8. After PR is merged
Delete your feature branch.
‚úÖ Congrats, you‚Äôve completed your first pull request!

Flow of Merging
All changes go into the testing branch.

Pull requests are reviewed and approved by Aisha.

Share the PR link with Aisha for approval.

Always include screenshots of UI changes or relevant code snippets.

Merging should follow this path:

rust
Copy code
feature branch -> testing branch -> develop branch -> main branch
Visual Diagram
csharp
Copy code
 [feature/my-task] 
         |
         v
     [testing]
         |
         v
     [develop]
         |
         v
      [main]
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never force push to any branch.

SSH Setup
